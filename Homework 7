% This script uses the method of least squares to approximate daily average
% temperatures for Rancho Cucamonga, CA using f(d) = a0 + a1*d + a2*cos(2*Pi*d/365.25 - phi).
% This scipt also plots the daily average termperature data against the
% generated least squares approximation.

% Original data to plot. Assume these are vectors for now and plot x vs y
x = []
y = []


% Matrix of coefficients for cos/sin
A = [1, 1, cos(2*pi*1/365.25) sin(2*pi*1/365.25);

    1, 3, cos(2*pi*3/365.25) sin(2*pi*3/365.25);

% Coefficients found from solving Ax = b, where x holds the a0, a1, a3, and
% a4 values
[C] = A\b;
a0 = C(1);

a4 = C(4);

% a2 is computed from a3 and a4 as these were separated to form a linear
% function. Phi is also related to a3 and a4 below.
a2 = sqrt(a3^2 + a4^2);
phi = arctan(a4/a3);

% Least squares approximation
f = @(d) a0+a1*d+a2*cos(2*pi*d/365.25 - phi);
% Generate plot of this funtion over the same range (and on same graph) as the x-y data above
