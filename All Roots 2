function [r, status] = AllRoots(c,x0,epsilon,maxitr,loud)
%AllRoots: This function attempts to find all roots of a polynomial.
%   This function uses Newton's Method to identify a root of the polynomial
%   whose coefficents are input as 'c'. After a root is identified, the
%   function uses deflation to form a new polynomial to replace 'c'
%   in the next iteration. This repeats, calling Nettons' Method until all roots
%   are found. Status = 0 indicates success. Status = 1 indicates that
%   Newton's Method failed. Status = 2 is reserved for other failure of the
%   function. User inputs 'epsilon' and 'maxitr' are the convergence
%   criteria and maximum iterations, respectively, used in Newton's Method.
